# üöó Fuel Level & Odometer Photo Submission Testing Guide

## üìã Overview
This guide covers comprehensive testing of the enhanced vehicle inspection system that includes fuel level and odometer readings with mandatory photo capture.

## üéØ Core Features to Test

### 1. Photo Submission Requirements
- **Fuel Level Photo**: Clear image of fuel gauge showing percentage
- **Odometer Photo**: Clear image of odometer display showing kilometers
- **File Validation**: Proper image format acceptance/rejection
- **Upload Process**: S3 presigned URL workflow

### 2. Data Validation
- **Fuel Level**: 0-100% range validation
- **Odometer**: Positive number validation
- **Required Fields**: Both readings and photos mandatory

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -d '{"contentType": "image/jpeg"}'

# Test photo confirmation
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/uploads/confirm \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -d '{
    "inspection_id": 123,
    "file_key": "org/1/photos/uuid",
    "part": "FUEL_GAUGE",
    "angle": "STRAIGHT",
    "width": 1280,
    "height": 720,
    "taken_at": "2025-01-26T10:15:00Z"
  }'

# Test inspection completion with photos
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/inspections/123/complete \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -d '{
    "status": "PASS",
    "fuel_level": 75,
    "odometer_km": 125000,
    "fuel_level_photo": "org/1/photos/fuel_uuid",
    "odometer_photo": "org/1/photos/odometer_uuid"
  }'
```

### Database Verification
```sql
-- Verify inspection record
SELECT id, status, fuel_level, odometer_km, fuel_level_photo, odometer_photo 
FROM inspections 
WHERE id = 123;

-- Verify photo records
SELECT id, inspection_id, part, file_key, width, height 
FROM photos 
WHERE inspection_id = 123;
```
