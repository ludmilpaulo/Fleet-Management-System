**Optional improvement:** Update ALLOWED_HOSTS to include 'taki.pythonanywhere.com' explicitly

### Step 2: Frontend (Vercel) - 2 minutes

Deploy to Vercel:
1. Visit https://vercel.com/new
2. Import: `ludmilpaulo/Fleet-Management-System`
3. Root Directory: `fleet/apps/web`
4. Add environment variables:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://taki.pythonanywhere.com/api
   NEXT_PUBLIC_MIXPANEL_TOKEN=c1cb0b3411115435a0d45662ad7a97e4
   ```
5. Click "Deploy"

### Step 3: Mobile (EAS) - 15 minutes

Build mobile apps:
```bash
cd fleet/apps/mobile
