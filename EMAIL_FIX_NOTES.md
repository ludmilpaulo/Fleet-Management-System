# Email Address Fix Notes

## Issue Identified
The dashboard image shows "contact@fleetcoro.com" (missing 'p') but the backend API returns the correct email "contact@fleetcorp.com".

## Investigation Results

### Backend API Response
```json
{
  "name": "FleetCorp Solutions",
  "email": "contact@fleetcorp.com",
  "subscription_plan": "professional"
}
```

### Frontend Code
- No hardcoded incorrect email addresses found
- All references use correct "fleetcorp.com" domain

### Possible Causes
1. **Browser Cache**: Frontend displaying cached data
2. **Different User Session**: Image might be from different user/company
3. **Cached State**: React state might be showing old data

## Resolution
Since the backend API is returning the correct email address, this appears to be a frontend caching issue. The fix would be to:

1. Clear browser cache
2. Force refresh the application
3. Ensure company data is fetched fresh from the API

## Verification
The production API correctly returns:
- Company Name: "FleetCorp Solutions"
- Email: "contact@fleetcorp.com" ✅ (correct)

## Status
✅ **Backend is correct** - No changes needed to backend
⚠️ **Frontend cache issue** - May need browser refresh or cache clearing
