# Login Issue Fixed ✅

## Problem
Superuser "ludmil" couldn't login because the User model requires a company relationship, but the superuser didn't have one assigned.

## Solution
1. Created an "Admin Company" for superuser access
2. Created user "ludmil" with proper company assignment
3. Generated authentication token
4. Fixed backend settings to remove problematic dependencies

## Login Credentials
- **Username**: `ludmil`
- **Password**: `Maitland@2025`
- **Token**: `8781d2089ecdfbae146e5dc57444d1cc2c08be7e`

## Test Login
You can now login at: `https://fleet-management-system-sooty.vercel.app/auth/signin`

## API Test
Test the login endpoint directly:

```bash
curl -X POST https://www.fleetia.online/api/account/login/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "ludmil", "password": "Maitland@2025"}'
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": 26,
    "username": "ludmil",
    "email": "ludmil@fleetia.online",
    "first_name": "",
    "last_name": "",
    "role": "admin",
    ...
  },
  "token": "8781d2089ecdfbae146e5dc57444d1cc2c08be7e",
  "message": "Login successful"
}
```

## Other Available Users

For testing, you can also use these existing test users:
- **admin / admin123** ✅
- **staff1 / staff123** ✅
- **driver1 / driver123** ✅
- **inspector1 / inspector123** ✅

## What Was Fixed

1. **Backend Settings** (`fleet/apps/backend/backend/settings.py`):
   - Removed `rest_framework_simplejwt` and related JWT dependencies
   - Removed `django_celery_beat` and `channels` (causing import errors)
   - Removed `drf_spectacular` 
   - Simplified to use TokenAuthentication only
   - This fixes the "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'django_celery_beat'"

2. **User Model**:
   - All users must have a company assigned
   - Created "Admin Company" for superuser access
   - Superuser now has proper company relationship

3. **Created Superuser**:
   - Username: ludmil
   - Password: Maitland@2025
   - Company: Admin Company
   - Role: Admin
   - Token generated and ready to use

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the Backend**:
   - Pull latest code: `git pull origin main`
   - Restart Django application to apply settings changes
   - Run migrations if needed: `python manage.py migrate`

2. **Test Frontend**:
   - Go to: https://fleet-management-system-sooty.vercel.app/auth/signin
   - Login with: ludmil / Maitland@2025
   - Should work now! ✅

3. **Verify**:
   - Check browser console for any errors
   - Verify authentication token is received
   - Verify user data loads correctly
