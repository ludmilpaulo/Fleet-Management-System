## 🧪 Test Execution Instructions

### For Realistic User Testing:

1. **Make sure backend is running:**
   ```bash
   cd fleet/apps/backend
   python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8001
   ```

2. **Create test users** (you'll need to do this):
   - Use Django admin or API to create users for each role
   - Or run: `python manage.py createsuperuser`

3. **Run realistic tests:**
   ```bash
   python3 realistic_user_testing.py
   ```

### For Manual Testing:

1. **Start Web App:**
   ```bash
   cd fleet/apps/web
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8001/api yarn dev
   ```

2. **Open browser:** http://localhost:3000

3. **Test each role:**
   - Login as Platform Admin
   - Login as Company Admin
   - Login as Staff
   - Login as Driver
   - Login as Inspector
